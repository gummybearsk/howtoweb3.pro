# NFT Security Guide: How to Protect Your Collection (2025)

## Why NFT Security Matters

In 2024 alone, ​**$100M+ in NFTs** were stolen through various attacks. Unlike cryptocurrencies, stolen NFTs are:

- Easier to identify (on-chain history)
- Harder to recover (no reversible transactions)
- Often sentimental (profile pictures, art collections)

**Analogy:** Your NFT collection is like a museum. You wouldn't leave museum doors unlocked or let strangers handle priceless art.

## Common NFT Attack Vectors

### 1. Wallet Drainers
Malicious smart contracts that empty your wallet when you:
- Sign "approve" transactions
- Connect to fake websites
- Interact with poisoned NFTs

### 2. Fake Mint Pages
Scam websites mimicking:
- Popular NFT projects
- "Free mint" opportunities
- Fake limited-time offers

### 3. Social Engineering
- Fake Discord/Twitter giveaways
- "Support" agents asking for your seed phrase
- Impersonation of famous artists/collectors

## NFT Security Levels

### Level 1: Basic Protection (Free)
- Use separate wallets for trading vs holding
- Bookmark real OpenSea/Blur URLs
- Verify contract addresses before minting

### Level 2: Enhanced Security (~$100)
- Hardware wallet (Ledger/Trezor)
- Burner wallet for risky interactions
- Wallet guard apps like Pocket Universe

### Level 3: Maximum Security (~$500+)
- Multi-sig vaults (Gnosis Safe)
- Cold storage for blue-chip NFTs
- Dedicated device for NFT activities

## Step-by-Step Protection Guide

### 1. Wallet Setup
1. Create ​**three separate wallets**:
   - ​**Hot Wallet**: Small funds for daily trading
   - ​**Vault Wallet**: Hardware wallet for valuables
   - ​**Burner Wallet**: Empty wallet for risky links

2. Use different browsers/profiles for each

### 2. Transaction Safety
Before signing ANY transaction:
1. Check the ​**domain** (is it the real site?)
2. Check the ​**contract address** (matches official?)
3. Check the ​**function** (what exactly are you approving?)

Use these tools:
- `revoke.cash` - Review token approvals
- `etherscan.io` - Verify contract code
- `pocketuniverse.app` - Simulate transactions

### 3. NFT Storage Options

| Method | Security Level | Cost | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hot Wallet | Low | Free | NFTs you trade daily |
| Hardware Wallet | Medium | $79-$149 | Valuable NFTs |
| Cold Storage | High | $300+ | Blue-chip long holds |
| Multi-sig | Very High | Gas fees | Teams/collectives |

## Advanced Protection Techniques

### 1. NFT Cold Storage
How to move NFTs offline:
1. Send to hardware wallet
2. Store seed phrase in fireproof safe
3. Never connect that wallet to any site

### 2. Delegated Wallets
Use `delegate.cash` to:
- Show NFTs without moving them
- Interact with dApps safely
- Keep vault wallet disconnected

### 3. Multi-sig Vaults
Require 2/3 signatures to:
- Move valuable NFTs
- Approve transactions
- Change security settings

## Real 2025 NFT Scams

### 1. Fake Azuki Migration
Scammers created a fake "Azuki 3.0 migration" site, stealing 32 Azukis worth ~$500k.

### 2. Poisoned BAYC Airdrop
Malicious NFTs sent to BAYC holders, draining wallets when viewed.

### 3. Blur Bid Phishing
Fake Blur bid emails leading to $2.3M in stolen NFTs.

## NFT Security Checklist

✅ Never click NFT links in DMs  
✅ Verify ALL contract addresses  
✅ Use hardware wallet for >1 ETH value  
✅ Bookmark real marketplaces  
✅ Check permissions monthly  

## FAQs

### Can stolen NFTs be recovered?
Rarely. Some marketplaces may freeze if reported quickly, but blockchain transactions are irreversible.

### Is OpenSea safe?
Generally, but hackers target users, not the platform itself. Always check URLs.

### How do I check NFT authenticity?
- Verify collection contract on Etherscan
- Check official project links
- Look for verified checkmarks

### Should I store NFTs on exchanges?
No. Not your keys, not your NFTs. Use self-custody wallets.

## Final Thoughts

Protecting NFTs requires different strategies than protecting fungible tokens. Remember:

- Your wallet is only as secure as your habits
- Scammers constantly evolve their tactics
- A few minutes of verification can prevent disaster

**Stay vigilant** and enjoy your collection safely!

**Disclaimer:** Security practices evolve. Always stay updated on the latest threats.
