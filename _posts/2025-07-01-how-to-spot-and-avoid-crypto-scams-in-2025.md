# How to Spot and Avoid Crypto Scams in 2025

## Why Crypto Scams Are So Common

Cryptocurrency scams cost victims â€‹**$4.3 billion** in 2024 alone. Scammers target crypto because:

- Transactions are irreversible
- Many new users lack experience
- Anonymity makes tracing difficult
- FOMO (fear of missing out) clouds judgment

**Analogy:** Crypto is like the Wild West - full of opportunity but also outlaws. You need to be your own sheriff.

## Most Common Crypto Scams in 2025

### 1. Phishing Scams (Fake Websites & Emails)

How it works:
- Fake login pages mimicking MetaMask, exchanges
- "Urgent" emails about account suspension
- Fake browser extensions

**Example:** `metamask-login[.]xyz` (real site is `metamask.io`)

### 2. Rug Pulls (Exit Scams)

Warning signs:
- Anonymous teams
- Unrealistic returns ("1000% APY!")
- Liquidity suddenly removed

**2025 Case Study:** "MoonTokenX" raised $2M then developers vanished.

### 3. Fake Support Scams

How it works:
- Fake support accounts on Twitter, Telegram
- "Your wallet is compromised" messages
- Asking for your seed phrase

**Remember:** No legitimate service will ever ask for your seed phrase.
