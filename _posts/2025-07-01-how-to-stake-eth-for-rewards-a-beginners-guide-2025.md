# How to Stake ETH for Rewards - A Beginner's Guide (2025)

## What is Staking ETH?

Staking means locking up your ETH so it helps secure Ethereum's blockchain. In return, you:

- Earn rewards (like interest)
- Support network security

Ethereum switched to Proof of Stake (PoS) in 2022. Now, the network relies on validators, not miners, to confirm transactions.

**Analogy:** Think of staking ETH as depositing money in a community savings fund. Your funds help the community run smoothly, and you earn a share of the profits.

## Why Stake ETH?

### Benefits of Staking ETH

- Earn passive income (3-5% annual returns)
- Help secure Ethereum's network
- Lower environmental impact vs mining
- Participate in Ethereum's future growth

Table: Staking vs Not Staking

| Factor | Holding ETH Only | Staking ETH |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Earn rewards | No | Yes (3-5%) |
| Network contribution | None | Helps security |
| Token locked? | No | Usually yes |
| Requires technical skills | No | Sometimes |

## Is Staking ETH Safe?

Generally safe - but there are risks:

- Use reputable platforms
- Understand lockup periods

### Option 1 - Stake Directly as a Validator

This method is advanced and requires:

- 32 ETH minimum
- Technical setup
- Running hardware 24/7

Not recommended for beginners. If your node goes offline, you could lose rewards (slashing).

### Option 2 - Stake via Staking Pools

Best for beginners. Pools let you stake:

- Any amount (no 32 ETH minimum)
- Without running hardware

Examples:
- Lido
- Rocket Pool
- Coinbase staking

3. ​**Connect Your Wallet**  
   Click Connect Wallet → MetaMask

4. ​**Enter Amount to Stake**  
   Example: 0.5 ETH  
   Lido shows:
   - Expected APR
   - Amount of stETH (token you receive)

5. ​**Confirm Transaction**  
   MetaMask pops up:
   - Approve gas fees
   - Complete transaction

You'll receive stETH representing your staked ETH.

Table: Staking Options

| Method | Min ETH | Control | Risks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Direct Validator | 32 ETH | Full | Slashing, tech needs |
| Lido/Rocket Pool | Any | Shared | Smart contract risk |
| Exchanges (Coinbase, Binance) | Any | Platform holds funds | Platform risk |
